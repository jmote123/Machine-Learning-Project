# Machine-Learning-Project
The company is trying to solve the problem of customers closing their credit account. The goal of my analysis is to identify the problems which causes the customers to close their credit accounts and making necessary recommendations to overcome that problem. The questions I am trying to answer are listed below:  
1. How is education effecting the customer status?
2. How does utilization ratio effect customer status? 
3. Which employment status has highest and least number of closed account and active account? 
4. How is credit limit related to customer status? 
5. Does income influence the customer status? 

Answering these questions matters as the company can investigate these parameters and improve their operations wherever necessary to smoothly function resulting in high profits.
